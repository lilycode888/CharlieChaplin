        <h2>Childhood</h2>
        <p>Charles Spencer Chaplin was born in London, England, on April 16th, 1889. His father was a versatile vocalist
            and
            actor;
            and his mother, known under the stage name of Lily Harley, was an attractive actress and singer, who gained
            a
            reputation
            for her work in the light opera field.

            Charlie was thrown on his own resources before he reached the age of ten as the early death of his father
            and
            the
            subsequent illness of his mother made it necessary for Charlie and his brother, Sydney, to fend for
            themselves.

        <p>
            Having inherited natural talents from their parents, the youngsters took to the stage as the best
            opportunity
            for a career. Charlie made his professional debut as a member of a juvenile group called “The Eight
            Lancashire
            Lads” and rapidly won popular favour as an outstanding tap dancer.
        </p>
        <h2>Beginning of his career</h2>
        <p>When he was about twelve, he got his first chance to act in a legitimate stage show, and appeared as “Billy”
            the
            page
            boy, in support of first H. A. Saintsbury and then William Gillette in different productions of “Sherlock
            Holmes”. At
            the close of this engagement, Charlie started a career as a comedian in vaudeville, which eventually took
            him to
            the
            United States in 1910 as a featured player with the Fred Karno Company.</p>

            alt="Alf and Amy Reeves, Muriel Palmer & Chaplin on the boat to America for the 1910 Karno tour">

        <p>He scored an immediate hit with American audiences, particularly with his characterization in a sketch
            entitled
            “A Night
            in an English Music Hall”. When the Fred Karno troupe returned to the United States in the fall of 1912 for
            a
            repeat
            tour, Chaplin was offered a motion picture contract.

            He finally agreed to appear before the cameras at the expiration of his vaudeville commitments in November
            1913;
            and his
            entrance in the cinema world took place that month when he joined Mack Sennett and the Keystone Film
            Company.
            His
            initial salary was $150 a week, but his overnight success on the screen spurred other producers to start
            negotiations
            for his services.</p>

        <p>At the completion of his Sennett contract, Chaplin moved on to the Essanay Company (1915) at a large
            increase.
            Sydney
            Chaplin had then arrived from England, and took his brother’s place with Keystone as their leading comedian.

            The following year Charlie was even more in demand and signed with the Mutual Film Corporation for a much
            larger
            sum to
            make 12 two-reel comedies. These include “The Floorwalker”, “The Fireman”, “The Vagabond”, “One A.M.” (a
            production in
            which he was the only character for the entire two reels with the exception of the entrance of a cab driver
            in
            the
            opening scene), “The Count”, “The Pawnshop”, “Behind the Screen”, “The Rink”, “Easy Street” (heralded as his
            greatest
            production up to that time), “The Cure”, “The Immigrant” and “The Adventurer”.</p>
        <h2>Gaining independence</h2>
        <p>When his contract with Mutual expired in 1917, Chaplin decided to become an independent producer in a desire
            for
            more
            freedom and greater leisure in making his movies. To that end, he busied himself with the construction of
            his
            own
            studios. This plant was situated in the heart of the residential section of Hollywood at La Brea Avenue.</p>

        <p>Early in 1918, Chaplin entered into an agreement with First National Exhibitors' Circuit, a new organization
            specially
            formed to exploit his pictures. His first film under this new deal was “A Dog's Life”. After this
            production, he
            turned
            his attention to a national tour on behalf of the war effort, following which he made a film the US
            government
            used to
            popularize the Liberty Loan drive: “The Bond”.

            His next commercial venture was the production of a comedy dealing with the war. “Shoulder Arms”, released
            in
            1918 at a
            most opportune time, proved a veritable mirthquake at the box office and added enormously to Chaplin's
            popularity.</p>
