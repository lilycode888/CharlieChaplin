            <p><strong><em>Charles Spencer Chaplin</em></strong> was born in London, England, on April
                16th, 1889. His father was a versatile vocalist and actor; and his mother, known
                under the stage name of Lily Harley, was an attractive actress and singer, who gained a reputation for
                her
                work in the
                light opera field.

                Charlie was thrown on his own resources before he reached the age of ten as the early death of his
                father
                and the
                subsequent illness of his mother made it necessary for Charlie and his brother, Sydney, to fend for
                themselves.

                Having inherited natural talents from their parents, the youngsters took to the stage as the best
                opportunity for a
                career. Charlie made his professional debut as a member of a juvenile group called “The Eight Lancashire
                Lads” and
                rapidly won popular favour as an outstanding tap dancer.<br><span class="full-article"><strong><a
